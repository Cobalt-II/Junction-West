# Junction-West
An exploratory work-in-progress branching function concept. The goal of this is to explore and visually examine a branching function that goes from left-right. Class JunctionWest creates a grid with constructor(length, height). jw is a variable that can be edited in console to edit the grid. jw.branch is the branching function of the variable. Branch takes three inputs: 
```
x: x value of where the branching starts on the grid,
y: y value of where the branching starts on the grid,
shifts: a variance value that for each shift will change the y value by 1 up or down, this value of this is the number of shifts that occur. More shifts = more variance.
```

By no means is this done, however this is merely an exploratory branching concept I've come up with, and wish to expand on. For what may I use this for? I don't know. Just thought it was an interesting concept.

shift values in order from top-bottom: 1000, 10, 50, 25
